# Minesweeper
Quick and dirty Minesweeper game implementation in .NET
The game logic was written in a couple of hours, but the UI took me... well weeks, i did not have time and it is still bad.

The game backend/core/engine is a .NET Standard library, and the UI is a WPF Desktop application.
There is also a plan for a Console application UI, which should be interesting...
