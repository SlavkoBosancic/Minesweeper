# Minesweeper
Quick and dirty Minesweeper game implementation in .NET<br />

The game logic was written in a couple of hours, but the UI took me... well weeks, i did not have time and it is still not good.<br />
Backend/core/engine is a .NET Standard 1.0 library, and the UI is a WPF Desktop application for .NET 4.5 and above.<br />
There is also a plan for a Console application UI, which should be interesting...
